## Info
This is a Garry's Mod addon that I've made a while ago. It simply defines playermodels to use in the "Trouble in Terrorist Town" gamemode.

## Features
- Random skin selection
- Add as many models as you want.
- Models automatically added to downloadlist.
- Models for detective and innocent/traitor roles.
- Configuration while Ingame (without restarting client/server and no there is no "ingame configuration menu")
- Support of all game hooks that the models stays anytime the same.

## Usage
When you fire up the addon the first time it will generate a new file.
You'll find it under 'garrysmod/data/ttt_custom_playermodels.txt' its written in JSON if you wanna now more about it then google it.

Example:
```
{ 
	"player1": "models/test/model.mdl", 
	"player2": "models/test2/model2.mdl", 
	"detective1": "models/test3/model3.mdl" 
} 
```
